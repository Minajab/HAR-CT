# Human Activity Recognition-Convolution Ternary (HAR-CT)
In this project we work with two dataset. Before use this code you should preprocess the datasets.

At first, a deep neural network is initially designed, developed, and trained, and then this network is compressed to decrease the amount of memory required for information processing.
